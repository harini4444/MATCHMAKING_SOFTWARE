# MATCHMAKING_SOFTWARE
Two people wants to know how much they are compatible to each other 
and how much their thoughts match. To solve this problem, we create a C 
program asking the two people some questions. If their answers match it 
will indicate how much their thoughts match and provide them with a score 
out of 100
